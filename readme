RLWE Lattice-Based Post-Quantum BTC and ETH Key Pair Generation
Overview
This project implements a Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) lattice-based quantum-resistant key exchange algorithm to generate post-quantum BTC and ETH key pairs. It ensures:

Quantum Resistance: RLWE-based shared secrets are resistant to attacks from quantum computers.
Compatibility: The shared secrets are used to derive private keys and public keys compatible with Bitcoin (secp256k1) and Ethereum standards.
Features
RLWE-Based Key Exchange:
Quantum-resistant shared secret generation using RLWE.
BTC Key Pair Generation:
Generates Bitcoin private keys, public keys, and valid Bitcoin addresses in Base58Check format.
ETH Key Pair Generation:
Generates Ethereum private keys and addresses compatible with Ethereum wallets.
Dependencies
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

bash
Copy code
npm install big-integer secp256k1 js-sha3 bitcoinjs-lib
big-integer: For modular arithmetic with large numbers.
secp256k1: For elliptic curve cryptography.
js-sha3: For Keccak-256 hashing (used in Ethereum).
bitcoinjs-lib: For Bitcoin address generation.
Key Components
1. RLWE Key Exchange
RLWE is used to generate a quantum-resistant shared secret between two parties. The key exchange involves:

Key Pair Generation: Generates a private key (random polynomial) and public key (FFT-transformed private key).
Encapsulation: Uses the recipient's public key to generate a ciphertext and shared secret.
Decapsulation: Uses the private key to recover the shared secret from the ciphertext.
2. BTC Key Pair Generation
The shared secret is converted into entropy, which is then used to:

Generate a Bitcoin private key.
Derive a compressed public key using the secp256k1 curve.
Create a Bitcoin address in Base58Check format.
3. ETH Key Pair Generation
The shared secret is converted into entropy, which is then used to:

Generate an Ethereum private key.
Derive a public key using the secp256k1 curve.
Hash the public key with Keccak-256 to generate the Ethereum address.

Limitations
Quantum Resistance:
BTC and ETH keys are quantum-resistant only until they are converted into ECC-based formats (secp256k1).
Full quantum resistance requires a blockchain supporting post-quantum cryptography.
Performance:
FFT-based RLWE computations may require optimization for large-scale use.
Future Improvements
Quantum-Resistant Wallets:
Integrate with a wallet supporting quantum-safe cryptography.
Blockchain Support:
Adapt for blockchains implementing post-quantum algorithms.
Performance Optimization:
Optimize FFT and modular arithmetic for better performance.
Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates how RLWE lattice-based cryptography can be used to generate quantum-resistant BTC and ETH keys. While the keys are compatible with current blockchain standards, future advancements in post-quantum cryptography will be required for end-to-end quantum resistance.
